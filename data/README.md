# Which Dataset?
we first choose US 101 data **ngsim** *(next generation simulation)* as our dataset. It contains 1300+ vehicle trajectory information, the structure of csv file is as follows.

## Description of NGSIM
To support the development of algorithms for driver behavior at microscopic levels, the Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) computer program is collecting detailed, high-quality traffic datasets. NGSIM stakeholder groups identified the collection of real-world vehicle trajectory data as important to understanding and researching driver behavior at microscopic levels. The NGSIM datasets represent the most detailed and accurate field data collected to date for traffic microsimulation research and development. The US Highway 101 (US 101) dataset was one of several datasets collected under the NGSIM program.
